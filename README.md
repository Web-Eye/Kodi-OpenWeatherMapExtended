OpenWeatherMap.Extended (Patched)
=

This is a fork of the well-known OpenWeatherMap.Extended addon by Ronie
Since this original addon won't work with Kodi 18, I decide to implement a quick workaround to have a running weather 
API for Kodi 18.

The Addon still uses Python 2.x, so it might not run in Kodi 19 or above.

Installation
-

Just decompress the "weather.openweathermap.extendend.patched" directory to your addon folder.  
You still need your OpenWeatherMap API Key
